abase - Aba's tools
===================

abase is a collection of tools that didn't fit into ubase or sbase.

Currently it contains the following:
- a very simple 'more' pager
- a simple 'hexdump'
- a 'fdisk' (but we have to decide for which kind of partition types
  and what kind of operations, could be too big)

Note: abase is a shameless copy of sbase/ubase in certain areas like
the Makefile, libutil, etc. This might also make an integration into
sbase/ubase easier.

Building
--------

To build abase, simply type make. You may have to fiddle with config.mk
depending on your system.

You can also build abase-box, which generates a single binary containing
all the required tools. You can then symlink the individual tools to
abase-box or run: make abase-box-install

Ideally you will want to statically link abase. If you are on Linux we
recommend using musl-libc[1].

Portability
-----------

Not really tested so far, but you should be able to build it with
gcc, clang, tcc, nwcc and pcc.
